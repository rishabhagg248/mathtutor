```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-tutoring-system.git
cd ai-tutoring-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install agents pydantic asyncio
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Usage

#### Basic Usage
```bash
python mathtutor.py
```

#### Programmatic Usage
```python
import asyncio
from mathtutor import triage_agent, Runner

async def get_tutoring_help(question):
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, question)
    return result.final_output

# Example usage
result = asyncio.run(get_tutoring_help("Explain how to solve quadratic equations"))
print(result)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Hierarchy

```
Triage Agent (Entry Point)
├── Input Guardrails
│   └── Homework Detection
├── Math Tutor Agent
└── History Tutor Agent
```

### Workflow Process

```
User Input → Homework Guardrail → Subject Detection → Specialist Agent → Educational Response
```

## 🛡️ Guardrail System

### Homework Detection Guardrail

The system includes a sophisticated guardrail to prevent students from getting direct homework answers:

```python
class HomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_homework: bool
    reasoning: str
```

#### Guardrail Logic
- **Purpose**: Detect homework-seeking behavior
- **Action**: Block direct answer provision
- **Alternative**: Provide educational guidance instead
- **Implementation**: AI-powered analysis with reasoning

### Guardrail Function
```python
async def homework_guardrail(ctx, agent, input_data):
    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, input_data, context=ctx.context)
    final_output = result.final_output_as(HomeworkOutput)
    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(
        output_info=final_output,
        tripwire_triggered=not final_output.is_homework,
    )
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Async Architecture
```python
async def main():
    # Concurrent processing support
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, user_question)
    return result.final_output
```

### Pydantic Models
```python
class HomeworkOutput(BaseModel):
    is_homework: bool
    reasoning: str
```

### Agent Framework
- **Library**: Custom `agents` framework
- **Features**: Handoffs, guardrails, async support
- **Integration**: OpenAI API backend

## 🔄 Request Flow

### 1. Input Processing
```
User Question → Triage Agent → Homework Guardrail
```

### 2. Guardrail Analysis
```
Guardrail Agent → Homework Detection → Allow/Block Decision
```

### 3. Subject Routing
```
Approved Request → Subject Classification → Specialist Agent
```

### 4. Educational Response
```
Specialist Agent → Explanatory Response → User
```

## 📝 Example Interactions

### Approved Educational Query
```python
# Input: "Explain how photosynthesis works"
# Output: Detailed explanation with steps and examples
# Routing: → Appropriate subject specialist
```

### Homework Detection
```python
# Input: "What's the answer to problem 5 on page 127?"
# Output: Homework detected - educational guidance provided instead
# Action: Guardrail triggered, learning assistance offered
```

### Subject-Specific Help
```python
# Math Query: "How do I approach calculus derivatives?"
# → Math Tutor: Step-by-step explanation with examples

# History Query: "What caused World War I?"
# → History Tutor: Contextual explanation of contributing factors
```

## 🚧 Development

### Adding New Subject Agents

1. **Create Specialist Agent**:
```python
science_tutor_agent = Agent(
    name="Science Tutor",
    handoff_description="Specialist agent for science questions",
    instructions="You provide help with science concepts. Explain phenomena clearly with examples.",
)
```

2. **Add to Triage Handoffs**:
```python
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    handoffs=[history_tutor_agent, math_tutor_agent, science_tutor_agent],
    # ... rest of configuration
)
```

### Custom Guardrails

Create additional guardrails for specific educational policies:

```python
class AgeAppropriateOutput(BaseModel):
    is_age_appropriate: bool
    age_recommendation: str

async def age_guardrail(ctx, agent, input_data):
    # Custom guardrail implementation
    pass
```

### Enhanced Triage Logic

Extend the triage agent with more sophisticated routing:

```python
triage_agent = Agent(
    instructions="""
    Analyze the user's question and determine:
    1. Subject area (Math, History, Science, etc.)
    2. Complexity level (Elementary, High School, College)
    3. Question type (Conceptual, Problem-solving, Research)
    Route to the most appropriate specialist agent.
    """
)
```
